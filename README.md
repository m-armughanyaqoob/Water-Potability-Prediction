# Water Potability Prediction Project

Water plays a crucial role in every living being's life. It is essential for major bodily functions, maintaining body temperature, and is used in various industries like food and medicine. Ensuring the potability (safety for consumption) of water is therefore critical. This project focuses on predicting whether a given sample of water is potable based on several factors.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting water potability using machine learning models.

### Dataset

The dataset used includes samples from various sources of water, with features that help determine potability.

### Building Models

We built several classification models to predict water potability:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Logistic regression is suitable for binary classification tasks, where it models the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class.

2. **Random Forest**
   - Random forest is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

3. **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)**
   - CART models were also explored, focusing on removing NA values and building decision trees based on the dataset.

## Files

- `Water_Potability.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for the project.
- `Water_Quality.R`: R script containing the same analysis but implemented in R.


## Conclusion

Understanding the factors that contribute to water potability is crucial for ensuring safe drinking water for all. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting water quality based on various parameters.
